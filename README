This is a OpenFlow switch for NetFPGA 1G CML.
To build it, place 'openflow_switch_1g_cml' directory under "$(NF_ROOT)/contraib-projects" and run make in the directory.

This project was implemented by 'reference_nic_1g_cml' and 'openflow_datapath_v1_00_a'.
It includes Xilinx CAM (xapp1151) in the 'openflow_switch_1g_cml/hw/pcores/openflow_datapath_v1_00_a'
